# Quality of Life (QoL) Scripts
## What are QoL scripts?
QoL scripts are little programs that make the experience of a user easier; whether that is through more efficient 
usage of resources, or through easier controls.

## "Why make your own, there's tons out there already!"
It helps build practice, as well as tailor the scripts to my needs. Some may even be of use to you! Hence the 
public repo.

### Requests
Feel free to PM me and request QoL scripts for anything, and I will see if it is within my capability. Please do not 
expect PhD-level scripts; I am a student after all!
